```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(pandoc)
library(aRbor)
library(knitr)
```

## Some information might have been removed during analysis

Be aware that the function dropped some tips of your phylogeny:
```{r echo = FALSE}
if (length(attributes(td)$dropped$dropped_from_data) >=1){
  kable(attributes(td)$dropped$dropped_from_data)
}else
   pander::pander("No data was dropped.")
```

It might has dropped information from your trait data as well: 
```{r, eval = T, echo = FALSE}
if (length(attributes(td)$dropped$dropped_from_tree) >=1){
    kable(attributes(td)$dropped$dropped_from_tree)
}else
  pander::pander("No data was dropped.")
```
